### DISCLAIMER: I gave up on MSAL and it isn't even my fault this time! lol
The premise was simple - I wanted to connect a Xamarin app to Azure AD B2C via the MSAL library, but I gave up. 
The docs are outdated tenfold. Constants vary from doc page to doc page. Every time the library is updated, a number of breaking changes happen, half of which I feel are not covered anywhere. 

Of course I could create an issue or two, but I don't see any benefit in it as MSAL/AD B2C is a product, not an open-source project.
